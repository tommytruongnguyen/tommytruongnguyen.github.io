<p>Yu-Gi-Oh! is a collectible trading card game from Japanese entertainment company, Konami. The card game was born from a original manga series by Kazuki Takahashi.The game was first launched in March 2002 in North America and continues to receive support to this day.</p>

<p>A "booster pack" is a sealed package of cards and/or figurines that is meant to provide players with additional cards to collect and customize their personal deck of cards. A single booster pack contains a randomly assorted set of cards. What cards can be obtained depends on the "series" that booster pack belongs to. In a sense, booster packs are the lifeblood of collectible trading card games. </p>
